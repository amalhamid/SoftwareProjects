C programming - Password Resilience Analyzer
In the realm of cybersecurity, the strength of passwords is crucial in defending sensitive information from unauthorized incursions and potential security breaches. 
The Password Resilience Analyzer has emerged as an essential tool in this arena, allowing both individuals and organizations to assess the resilience of their passwords against the onslaught of brute-force and sophisticated attacks. 
By mimicking possible attack strategies on a selected password, the Resilience analyzer offers a deeper understanding of the potential vulnerabilities inherent in a password, prompting users to develop stronger, more secure combinations. 
As cyber threats continue to advance in complexity, ensuring that passwords are fortified against these challenges is of utmost importance, and tools like the Password Resilience Analyzer are indispensable allies in this dynamic digital theater.

Objective:
Design and develop a software program using the C language, aptly named the "Password Resilience Analyzer". 
This program will be tasked with assessing the strength of a password, bearing in mind a set of predetermined rules and guidelines.

Background: 
In today's digitally-driven age, a strong password is more than just a gatekeeper to personal accountsâ€”it's a fortress that guards sensitive data and ensures digital security. 
But, what really defines the strength of a password? It's not merely about length or complexity; it's about understanding a mix of characteristics that withstand various hacking techniques. 
Factors like length, use of diverse character sets, avoidance of predictable patterns, and the non-reliance on easily guessable information all come into play. 
With cyber threats becoming increasingly sophisticated, the importance of robust passwords cannot be overstated. 
Through the Password Resilience Analyzer, you'll delve deep into the anatomy of passwords, examining specific traits and characteristics to determine their robustness. 
By the end of this project, you'll not only master the art of creating strong passwords but also be equipped with the skills to help others understand and appreciate the nuances of password security.
